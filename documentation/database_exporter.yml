  # Scrape timeouts ensure that:
  #   (i)  scraping completes in reasonable time and
  #   (ii) slow queries are canceled early when the database is already under heavy load
  # Prometheus informs targets of its own scrape timeout (via the "X-Prometheus-Scrape-Timeout-Seconds" request header)
  # so the actual timeout is computed as:
  #   min(scrape_timeout, X-Prometheus-Scrape-Timeout-Seconds - scrape_timeout_offset)
  #
  # If scrape_timeout <= 0, no timeout is set unless Prometheus provides one. The default is 10s.
  scrape_timeout: 10s
  # Subtracted from Prometheus' scrape_timeout to give us some headroom and prevent Prometheus from timing out first.
  #
  # Must be strictly positive. The default is 500ms.

  # Minimum interval between collector runs: by default (0s) collectors are executed on every scrape.

  # Maximum number of open connections to any one target. Metric queries will run concurrently on multiple connections,

  # If max_connections <= 0, then there is no limit on the number of open connections. The default is 3.
  max_connections: 3
  # Maximum number of idle connections to any one target. Unless you use very long collection intervals, this should
  # always be the same as max_connections.

    #     * with multiple value columns, a `value_label` must be defined; the column name will populate this label and
